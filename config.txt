# topsig config
# comments begin with #
# arguments are of the form
# VARIABLE = VALUE

# the same variables can be specified on the command line
# in the form of -VARIABLE VALUE
# However, strings must be quoted. e.g. 
#  QUERY-TEXT = the quick brown fox
# is equivalent to
#  -QUERY-TEXT "the quick brown fox"
# on the command line.

# Additional config files can be included with:
# CONFIG = additional_config_file.txt
# or through specifying -CONFIG additional_config_file.txt on the
# command line. As a general rule, the last declaration of an attribute
# will hold, so with:
#  TARGET-PATH = a.tar.gz
#  TARGET-PATH = a.tar.bz2
# the final value for TARGET-PATH will be a.tar.bz2 (unless it is
# overridden later.

# INDEXING
#----------------------------------------------------------------------

# Indexing target. Specify a file or a directory of files to index.
# Examples:
# TARGET-PATH = foo.tar.gz
# TARGET-PATH = ~/foo.tar.gz
# TARGET-PATH = C:/stuff/foo.tar.gz
# TARGET-PATH = foobar
# TARGET-PATH = C:/stuff/foobar

# Additional files/directories can be added through TARGET-PATH-2,
# TARGET-PATH-3 etc.
# Examples:
# TARGET-PATH-2 = bar.tar.gz
# TARGET-PATH-3 = somestuff
# Virtually any number of extra targets can be added in this fashion.

# The format of the target file (either a single file or a directory of
# files)
# Examples:
# TARGET-FORMAT = file
# TARGET-FORMAT = tar
# TARGET-FORMAT = wsj
# TARGET-FORMAT = warc
# TARGET-FORMAT = newline

# The compression format of the target.
# Examples
# TARGET-FORMAT-COMPRESSION = none
# TARGET-FORMAT-COMPRESSION = gz
# TARGET-FORMAT-COMPRESSION = bz2

# Filter to run while processing documents. Unnecessary for plain text,
# may be useful for documents with markup.
# Examples:
# TARGET-FORMAT-FILTER = none
# TARGET-FORMAT-FILTER = xml
TARGET-FORMAT-FILTER = none

# How to form the document ID from the path for file system and archive
# formats (e.g. file, tar)
# Examples: (pages/003/15032003.xml)

# DOCID-FORMAT = basename (15032003)
# DOCID-FORMAT = basename.ext (15032003.xml)
# DOCID-FORMAT = xmlfield (depends)

# specified with the configuration param XML-DOCID-FIELD. e.g.

# This would use the text between <docname> and </docname> in the file
